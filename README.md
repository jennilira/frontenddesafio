# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

in this project i'm using `yarn` 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn  start`
and 
## `yarn add global` 

---
maybe you will have some poblem with "react-input-mask " to solve this problem:

##yarn add react-input-mask --dev
